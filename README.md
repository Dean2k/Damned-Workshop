The only thing that this tool currently does is make installing/uninstalling the public test patch easy. A lot more will be added and all progress is kept track here.

# Issues

If there are any bugs in the program, please let me know in the coding-changes text channel in the Damned Discord. I have tested this so it should work fine.
