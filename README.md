# Damned Workshop

![Screenshot of the program as of the last commit](https://github.com/Sweats/Damned-Workshop/blob/master/DamnedWorkshopPicture.png)

This tool currently does the following:

* Makes installing the public test patch very easy. No more dragging and dropping files by hand. 
* *Makes adding/removig stages from the game very easy. No more dragging and dropping multiple files and sorting all of them by hand and making mistakes in the process (it really is a pain). See next section for more details.
* Allows you to participate in the public test patch easily and restore your game back to the retail patch because the tool is smart enough to remove added files from the public test patch.
* ...And more will be added over time. 


# Adding/Removing stages.

Unless you are using the public test build and helping out with testing our changes, do not touch the mapping portion of the Damned Workshop. This is because the current retail game uses DamnedStages.png for loading images into the game while the PTB now uses generated image names/xml files to add/remove stages from the game.

# Issues

If there are any bugs in the program, please let me know in the coding-changes text channel in the Damned Discord. I have tested this so it should work fine.
